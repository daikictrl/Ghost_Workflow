- [x] Integrated `ShapePanel` into the `CollaborativeWorkspace` canvas area (`components/editor/collaborative-workspace.tsx`)
- [x] Prevented auto-zooming out and jumping of the canvas viewport on shape drops by implementing a custom programmatic `fitView` that runs only on initial load for existing nodes, leaving empty canvas instances at a normal zoom level (1.0).

### Phase 13: Node Shape Rendering & Drag Preview
- [x] Replaced placeholder rectangular node styling with dynamic shape-specific renders:
  - CSS styling for `rectangle`, `pill`, and `circle` shapes

- [x] Added keyboard listeners on Escape (discard/exit), Enter (submit/exit), and Blur to gracefully exit editing state
- [x] Refined shape sizing, padding, and text weight: shrunk default shape template dimensions by ~40%, reduced custom node padding to `p-0.5`, and set text styling to `text-[10px]` with `font-light` weight.
- [x] Increased font size of node labels from `text-[6.4px]` to `text-[12.1px]` (bold with `lineHeight: 14px`) and edge labels from `text-[10px]` to `text-[15.7px]` (bold) to improve readability.
- [x] Changed all selection outline indicators to an ultra-thin white style, including 4px circular white dots and thin 0.5px white dashed selection borders for resizer controls.
- [x] Resized connection handles (`Handle`) to 1.5px (6px) and styled them solid white to sit flush on selection outlines when selected or hovered.

### Phase 15: Nodes Color Toolbar
- [x] Added floating color swatch toolbar above selected canvas nodes

- [x] Configured pill badges for saved labels and dashed hint badges for active edges without labels.
- [x] Registered custom edge renderer and configured `defaultEdgeOptions` in `CollaborativeCanvas`.
- [x] Fixed edge lag/after-effect during node movement by scoping the CSS transition in `CustomEdge` specifically to `stroke,stroke-width` instead of `all` to prevent animating the SVG path coordinate modifications.
- [x] Configured `LiveblocksProvider` throttle option to `16` (60FPS updates) in `RoomWorkspace` to keep real-time position updates completely smooth.

- [x] Excluded `"ai-agent"` from top-right collaborator avatar list in `PresenceAvatars` to avoid duplicate avatar confusion.
- [x] Fixed chat message bubble overflow and scrollbar overlapping in AI Sidebar by shifting ScrollArea padding inwards and applying `break-words` and `min-w-0` layout wraps.
- [x] Fixed loading spinner and input block lockup on fast or instant task completions (like conversational prompts) by using a centralized React `useEffect` to watch terminal run states, handling both transitions and already-completed run mounts.
- [x] Updated canvas node dimensions to be larger (roughly double) and increased custom node label font size from 12.1px to 13.5px for improved text readability.
- [x] Aligned manual shape templates in the editor shape panel with the new, larger default node sizes.
- [x] Resolved missing edge labels by supporting root-level `label` props in `CustomEdge` and updating `design-agent` to write labels under both root `label` and `data.label` paths.
- [x] Refactored design agent spacing instructions to lay out nodes compactly (240px-280px center-to-center) and mandated descriptive connection labels in Gemini prompts.
- [x] Verified full type-safety and successful clean Next.js build compilation.

### Phase 29: Spec Generation Flow
- [x] Created `POST /api/ai/spec` — validates input with Zod, resolves project from `roomId` only (no client-supplied `projectId`), triggers `generate-spec` task, persists `TaskRun` record, returns `runId` and run-scoped public token
- [x] Created `POST /api/ai/spec/token` — validates `runId`, verifies `TaskRun` ownership by authenticated user, issues a 1-hour scoped public access token
- [x] Created `trigger/generate-spec.ts` — Zod-validated payload, builds structured Gemini prompt from nodes/edges/chat history, calls `generateText` via `runWithFailover`, updates run metadata for realtime tracking, returns plain Markdown output
- [x] Verified full type-safety and successful clean Next.js production build compilation

### Phase 30: Spec Persistence & Download
- [x] Created `ProjectSpec` Prisma model (`prisma/models/project_spec.prisma`) with `id`, `projectId` (FK → Project with cascade delete), `filePath`, and `createdAt`
- [x] Added `specs ProjectSpec[]` back-relation to `Project` model
- [x] Ran migration `20260604220714_add_project_spec` and regenerated Prisma Client
- [x] Updated `trigger/generate-spec.ts` to upload Markdown spec to Vercel Blob at `specs/{projectId}/{specId}.md`, persist `ProjectSpec` record with blob URL, and expose `specId` in run metadata and task output
- [x] Created `GET /api/projects/[projectId]/specs/[specId]/download` — authenticates user, verifies project access via `checkProjectAccess`, confirms spec belongs to project, fetches private blob, streams as `Content-Disposition: attachment` Markdown file
- [x] Verified full type-safety and successful clean Next.js production build (exit code 0)

### Phase 31: Spec UI Integration
- [x] Installed `react-markdown` and `remark-gfm` for client-side Markdown rendering
- [x] Created `GET /api/projects/[projectId]/specs` — authenticates via `checkProjectAccess`, returns list of spec metadata (`id`, `filename`, `createdAt`) ordered newest-first
- [x] Created `components/editor/spec-preview-modal.tsx` — Dialog-based modal that fetches spec content through the existing download endpoint (not Blob directly), renders it as styled Markdown with GFM tables/links, and exposes a Download action
- [x] Updated Specs tab in `ai-sidebar.tsx`: replaced static demo card with a live spec list, added fetch-on-tab-activate pattern via `useCallback`/`useEffect`, wired clickable items to preview modal, per-item download button (revealed on hover), empty/loading/error states, and refresh control
- [x] Wired `handleGenerateSpec` to the real `POST /api/ai/spec` endpoint with a 3-second delayed spec list refresh
- [x] Verified zero TypeScript errors (`tsc --noEmit` exit code 0)

### Phase 32: Spec Section Overhaul — One Spec Per Project
- [x] Enforced one-spec-per-project in `trigger/generate-spec.ts` by deleting existing specs (blob + DB) before creating the new one
- [x] Replaced multi-spec "Saved Specs" list in `ai-sidebar.tsx` with a single spec card per project
- [x] Added spec generation run tracking via `useRealtimeRun` so the loading indicator stays active until the background task reaches a terminal state (not just the trigger request)
- [x] Auto-refreshes the current spec card on successful generation completion
- [x] Added `projectId`-change effect to clear spec state for proper project isolation
- [x] Button dynamically shows "Regenerate Tech Spec" when a spec already exists
- [x] Added live generation status indicator strip with pulsing dot during spec generation
- [x] Fixed spec preview modal scrollability by replacing `ScrollArea` with native `overflow-y-auto` on the dialog body
- [x] Removed unused `ScrollArea` import from `spec-preview-modal.tsx`
- [x] Verified full type-safety with zero TypeScript errors (`tsc --noEmit` exit code 0)

### Phase 33: Design Agent — Label Separation & Layout Improvement
- [x] Rewrote the AI system prompt to strictly separate node labels (component names ONLY) from edge labels (protocol/relationship ONLY, max 1-3 words)
- [x] Added explicit good/bad examples in the prompt to prevent verbose labels like "HTTPS/View Courses" or "Writes/Reads User Data"
- [x] Increased minimum node spacing from 240-280px to 350px horizontal / 300px vertical to prevent edge labels from overlapping node boxes
- [x] Added edge routing rules: distribute handles across different sides of the same node when it has multiple connections
- [x] Added `labelOffsetPct` field to edge schema so the AI can stagger labels at 0.3/0.5/0.7 along a path instead of all sitting at the midpoint
- [x] Updated `custom-edge.tsx` to support offset-based label positioning via `data.labelOffsetPct`
- [x] Updated edge storage patch to persist `labelOffsetPct` alongside label in edge data
- [x] Verified full type-safety with zero TypeScript errors (`tsc --noEmit` exit code 0)

## Next Steps
- [ ] Continue with the next phase of system enhancements.
